# Contributing

## General Guidelines

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to create a pull request! Someone will review and merge it as soon as possible. 
However, before doing that, there are some simple rules that you must follow:

1. Keep your pull requests small and understandable (1 feature/bug fix per pull request). This is a collaborative project, so you must allow others to follow along.
2. Detailed description. Provide a detailed description of the changes made in the pull request. Explain the problem you are addressing, the solution you have implemented, and any relevant considerations. This helps reviewers understand the context and the reasons behind the changes.
3. Code readability. Write clean and readable code and follow the project's code conventions (you can find them down below) to maintain consistency within the codebase.

## Code Style

We're not very strict about coding conventions, but there are some basic guidelines you must follow:

- Indent: 2 spaces
- `PascalCase` for classes
- `camelCase` for functions, variables, etc.
